## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical technique that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The dependent variable is the variable that is being predicted, while the independent variables are the variables that are used to predict the dependent variable.

In a linear regression model, the dependent variable is a linear function of the independent variables. That is, the dependent variable is a linear function of the independent variables.

## Logistic Regression 

Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes. That is, it can be used to predict whether an event will occur or not. For example, we can use logistic regression to predict whether a patient will develop a disease, based on certain characteristics.

Logistic regression is a type of linear regression, but with a few important differences. First, the outcome variable is binary, which means it can only take two values (0 or 1). Second, the model is fit using a maximum likelihood estimation, rather than least squares.
