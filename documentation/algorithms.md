# Neural Network Training Script

## Overview

This script utilizes TensorFlow.js (Node.js version) to create, train, and predict with a neural network for a synthetic dataset. The workflow involves data generation, model training, and prediction.

## Import TensorFlow.js

```javascript
const tf = require("@tensorflow/tfjs-node");
```

Import the TensorFlow.js Node.js library.

## Data Generation (`generateData` function)

```javascript
const generateData = (numPoints, coeff, sigma = 0.04) => {
  // ...

  return {
    xs,
    ys: ysNormalized,
  };
};
```

- The `generateData` function generates synthetic data for training a model based on a polynomial equation.
- It uses TensorFlow.js (`tf`) to create tensors for coefficients and random input values (`xs`).
- The polynomial is generated with some added noise, and the output values (`ys`) are normalized to the range [0, 1].

## Model Training (`trainModel` function)

```javascript
async function trainModel(xs, ys) {
  // ...

  return model;
}
```

- The `trainModel` function defines, compiles, and trains a neural network model using TensorFlow.js.
- The model architecture consists of an input layer with 1 unit, a hidden layer with 4 units and ReLU activation, and an output layer with 1 unit and linear activation.
- The model is compiled with mean squared error as the loss function and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer.
- It is trained using the provided input (`xs`) and output (`ys`) tensors for 100 epochs.

## Main Execution (`run` function)

```javascript
async function run() {
  // ...

  console.log("Output predictions:", predictionsArray);

  // Cleanup memory
  trainedModel.dispose();
  unNormPreds.dispose();
  testXs.dispose();
}
```

- The `run` function orchestrates the entire process, including data generation, model training, and making predictions.
- It sets static coefficients for the polynomial and the number of data points.
- Training data is generated using the `generateData` function.
- The model is trained using the generated training data.
- Predictions are made on a new set of data points, un-normalized, and output to the console.
- Memory cleanup is performed using the `dispose` method on TensorFlow.js tensors.

## Run the Script

```javascript
run();
```

The script is executed by calling the `run` function.

```markdown
# LSTM Model Training Script with TensorFlow.js

## Overview

This Node.js script uses TensorFlow.js (Node.js version) to create, train, and use a sequential model with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer. The script demonstrates the creation of a neural network capable of handling sequential data.

## Import TensorFlow.js

```javascript
const tf = require("@tensorflow/tfjs-node");
```

Import the TensorFlow.js Node.js library.

## Create a Sequential Model

```javascript
const model = tf.sequential();
```

Create a sequential model. This model allows the definition of a linear stack of layers.

## Configure the LSTM Layer

```javascript
model.add(
  tf.layers.lstm({
    units: 50,
    inputShape: [10, 1],
    returnSequences: false,
  })
);
```

- Add an LSTM layer to the model with 50 units, an input shape of [10, 1] (representing 10 timesteps and 1 feature per step), and `returnSequences` set to false (indicating that the next layer is not recurrent).

## Add a Dense Output Layer

```javascript
model.add(
  tf.layers.dense({
    units: 1,
    activation: "linear",
  })
);
```

- Add a dense output layer with 1 unit and linear activation, suitable for a single continuous output value.

## Compile the Model

```javascript
model.compile({
  loss: "meanSquaredError",
  optimizer: "adam",
});
```

Compile the model with a mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer.

## Create Dummy Sequential Data

```javascript
const xs = tf.randomNormal([100, 10, 1]);
const ys = tf.randomNormal([100, 1]);
```

- Create dummy sequential input (`xs`) and output (`ys`) data for training.

## Train the Model

```javascript
async function trainModel() {
  await model.fit(xs, ys, {
    epochs: 50,
    batchSize: 32,
    callbacks: {
      onEpochEnd: (epoch, logs) => {
        console.log(`Epoch ${epoch + 1}: Loss = ${logs.loss}`);
      },
    },
  });

  // After training, the model can be used to predict on new data
  model.predict(tf.randomNormal([1, 10, 1])).print();
}
```

- Define an asynchronous function `trainModel` to train the model using the `fit` method.
- Display the loss on each epoch end using a callback.
- After training, use the trained model to make a prediction on new data.

## Run the Training

```javascript
trainModel()
  .then(() => console.log("Model training complete"))
  .catch((err) => console.error("Model training encountered an error:", err));
```

Execute the `trainModel` function and log the completion or any encountered errors.

Sure, let's break down the provided JavaScript code and create a Markdown (.md) version of it with explanations:

```markdown
# LSTM Model Training with TensorFlow.js

```javascript
const tf = require("@tensorflow/tfjs-node");

var fs = require("fs");
var performance = require("perf_hooks").performance;
```

## Introduction

This JavaScript program utilizes the TensorFlow.js library to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for a specific sequence task. The task involves generating sequences of 0s and 1s and training a model to predict whether a given sequence contains four or more consecutive and identical items (either 0s or 1s). The labels for the sequences are binary (0 or 1), where 1 indicates the presence of the specified pattern and 0 indicates its absence.

## Constants

```javascript
const sequenceLength = 10;
const stretchLengthThreshold = 4;
```

These constants define the length of each sequence (`sequenceLength`) and the threshold for consecutive identical items to trigger a positive label (`stretchLengthThreshold`).

## Data Generation Functions

```javascript
function generateSequenceAndLabel(len) {
  // ... (explained below)
}

function generateDataset(numExamples, sequenceLength) {
  // ... (explained below)
}
```

These functions generate sequences and labels based on the defined pattern. `generateSequenceAndLabel` generates a single sequence and its associated label, while `generateDataset` generates a dataset of sequences and their corresponding labels.

## TensorFlow.js Setup

```javascript
tf.nextFrame = function () {
  // ... (explained below)
};
```

This sets up a custom `nextFrame` function in TensorFlow.js, likely for handling asynchronous operations.

## Model Training

```javascript
function train() {
  // ... (explained below)
}
```

This function trains the LSTM model using TensorFlow.js. It defines the model architecture, compiles it, generates training data, and executes the training process.

## Training Execution

```javascript
train()
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

This code initiates the training process and logs the result or any errors.

### Additional Explanation

The `generateSequenceAndLabel` function creates random sequences of 0s and 1s, following the specified pattern, and assigns labels accordingly. The `generateDataset` function uses this to generate a dataset of sequences and labels.

The training process involves defining an LSTM model, compiling it, generating training data, and fitting the model using the generated data. Training progress is logged, including batch and epoch information.

The code also includes memory cleanup steps and handles asynchronous operations during training.

end

## 5/ KNN:

begin

Certainly, here's the explanation of the provided code in Markdown format:

```markdown
# k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classification Example

```javascript
// Create a manual dataset
const data = [
  [1.0, 2.0],
  [2.0, 3.0],
  [3.0, 4.0],
  [4.0, 5.0],
  // Add more data as needed
];

const labels = [
  [0],
  [0],
  [1],
  [1],
  // Add more labels as needed
];
```

This section initializes a manual dataset for training a kNN classifier. `data` contains input features, and `labels` contains corresponding class labels.

```javascript
// Convert the dataset to JavaScript arrays
const features = data.map((row) => row.map((val) => val));
const labelsArray = labels.map((row) => row[0]);
```

Here, the `features` and `labelsArray` are created by mapping over the original data to convert it into plain JavaScript arrays.

```javascript
// Normalize the features
const min = Math.min(...features.flat());
const max = Math.max(...features.flat());
const normalizedFeatures = features.map((row) =>
  row.map((val) => (val - min) / (max - min))
);
```

This part normalizes the features in the dataset to ensure that all values are within a consistent range (usually between 0 and 1).

```javascript
// Split the data into training and testing sets
const splitIndex = Math.floor(normalizedFeatures.length / 2);
const trainFeatures = normalizedFeatures.slice(0, splitIndex);
const testFeatures = normalizedFeatures.slice(splitIndex);
const trainLabels = labelsArray.slice(0, splitIndex);
const testLabels = labelsArray.slice(splitIndex);
```

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

```javascript
// Implement k-Nearest Neighbors function for multiple inputs and outputs
function knn(predictFeatures, k = 3) {
  // ... (explained below)
}
```

This defines the kNN function, which takes a set of features and predicts the class label based on the k-nearest neighbors in the training data.

```javascript
// Test the kNN function
const testPredictions = testFeatures.map((features) => knn(features, 3));

console.log("Test Predictions:", testPredictions);
```

The kNN function is applied to the test set to make predictions, and the results are printed to the console.

```javascript
```

This closing backtick denotes the end of the Markdown code block.
